This picture is circulating the internet following WhatsApps change in terms. Why does Facebook need all this access for a messenging application? Well to make more money of course. However, do you really want to share all this just to chat with your friends? 

Apple marks an app as asking for “Sensitive Info” when it asks for data ranging from data on a person’s race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, as well as data on a person’s religion, pregnancy status, or political opinions. Biometric data in all of its forms also falls under this umbrella.

No-one or company needs to know this unles there’s a genuine reason. If you live somewhere with privacy laws, like Europe, then whilst you probably should be covered I wouldn’t trust them to not “accidentally” collect all your information and ship it overseas. There’s also the principle of it, you might be lucky to be protected by the law but many others aren’t. So why should you support, encourage and accept these behaviours by continuing to use their apps.

Do yourself a favour and install [Signal](https://signal.org/download/), and then delete the others.
